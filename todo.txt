Scope
[X]- Reusable NavBar component with three responsive modes:
[]- Mobile: hamburger icon opens a dropdown or drawer menu.
[X]- Tablet: same layout as the existing hardcoded navbar,
 including the hide on scroll feature.
[X]- Desktop: full width normal navbar.
[]- Finish Connect page responsiveness across common breakpoints.

Acceptance criteria
[]- Mobile width up to 639 px: hamburger icon present, menu opens and 
closes correctly, focus trap for accessibility, body scroll locked when open.
[]- Tablet 640 to 1023 px: navbar matches current design including hide
 on scroll. No layout shifts when hiding or showing. Keyboard nav and 
 ARIA attributes present.
[]- Desktop 1024 px and up: full navbar with inline links. Hover and 
active states follow our design tokens.
[]- Connect page renders without horizontal scroll at 
360, 390, 414, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440 px widths. Key sections 
stack or wrap cleanly, images scale with max width 100 percent and height auto, and text maintains readable line length.
[]- Implementation checklist
[]- Extract links and CTA into a shared config so the component
 is reusable.
[]- Use a single source of truth for route paths.
[]- Add hide on scroll using a scroll listener with
 requestAnimationFrame to avoid jank.
[]- Add aria controls and aria expanded on the hamburger
 button, and role menu for the dropdown.
[]- Close the menu on route change and on Escape key.
[]- Add unit tests for hide on scroll logic and open or 
close menu reducer if applicable.
[]- Add Storybook stories for mobile, tablet, desktop.
